# CallbackCats - EngageMate

## This is the back end of our application.

This part of the app is deployed on Heroku for continuous deployment. The backend features a REST api built with Express, Socket IO for web socket implementation, and a PostgreSQL database to store the users and application data.

_**Remote teaching delivery? Headache no more!**_
